# AI Literacy

Published: August 11, 2025

## **AI-Generated Divide**

In college, I worked with professors studying how AI adoption might affect economic disparities between countries—particularly between heavily investing nations like the US and smaller Latin American economies. This research focused on macroeconomic patterns, but watching AI unfold in real time has shifted my attention to similar disparities at the individual level.

I recently came across a prominent tech investor's tweet about a founder he met who writes 10,000 lines of code daily with AI. What caught my attention wasn't just the number—it was that this person has gotten so comfortable with AI that they're choosing not to hire anyone because they'd rather keep coding than take time for interviews.

Examples like this illustrate a wider trend among highly technical people who found systematic ways to leverage AI, and less technical people who are still experimenting with AI sporadically. The same dynamics that exist between countries are unfolding between individuals.

To better understand how this dynamic may unfold, let's simplify AI adoption patterns. While AI adoption exists on a spectrum, for the sake of this discussion, let's focus on two broad groups: purposeful and sporadic. Purposeful adopters are highly literate with these systems; they probably contribute to building these tools and are equipped to effectively integrate AI to optimize their lives. Sporadic adopters are somewhat AI literate; this group is more diverse, ranging from the AI-curious who engage with tools they see in the news to people who randomly throw questions at ChatGPT.

Given this distinction, it's fair to assume that purposeful adopters are benefiting from the technology the most today. The real-world impact of these benefits is most apparent in technical contexts, but as the rest of the world catches up, the impact of AI literacy will materialize across technical and non-technical fields alike.

## **Long-Term Impact of AI Literacy**

What makes understanding this disparity unique is the timing. Although ChatGPT's "AI moment" was in 2022, we are still in the very early stages of the AI transition. It's too early to define what the "benefits" of AI adoption are: time, productivity, money. But given the pace at which this transition is evolving and the glacial pace of tech policy to guide AI deployment, we must discover that for ourselves in our own lives. Otherwise, we risk building towards an undesirable future.

While sporadic adopters will certainly benefit from AI, those benefits will be negligible compared to the benefits that purposeful adopters enjoy. Behavioral research reveals that small, consistent habits create meaningful changes that build momentum over time. This principle helps us create a mental model to visualize the long-term impact of being purposeful versus sporadic adopters. These tools will likely become more intuitive and accessible over time—as most technologies do—but there's a significant window of opportunity right now. Those who invest in effectively integrating these systems in their lives today are capturing benefits that may take others years to realize, even as the tools themselves improve.

Understanding this opportunity cost is essential for practicing modern stewardship in an AI-enabled world. Kobe Bryant exemplified this systematic approach to skill development. He didn't just practice—he arrived at the gym four hours before games to work on specific drills, spent hours breaking down film to study opponents' habits and weaknesses, and approached basketball like a craft, not just a sport. He systematically moved around the court, making 15-20 shots from each spot before moving on, turning skill development into a methodical process.

This same systematic approach applies to AI fluency. There's an alternative future—the desirable future state—where sporadic adopters apply this principle to develop systems that help us capitalize on the technology’s benefits.

## **The Desirable Future State**

I stay away from clickbait content creators who claim to have the best technology stack to improve your life, because our lifestyles, preferences, and objectives are unique. The tools that may help a person who is early in their career look dramatically different from the tools that may help a senior-level executive. The most important connection I can draw between the two is the underlying principles that are necessary for becoming purposeful adopters: learn, experiment, apply, and evaluate the different tools that we use to enhance our lives.

The AI news cycle and some tools’ technical interfaces discourage exploration, but this framework will help us approach it with humility and curiosity—and hopefully enjoy it.

- **Learn**: It has never been easier to get a comprehensive overview of the tools available that may be most relevant to you. A detailed research prompt in Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT will produce a great starting point. Most apps have free trials to help us get an understanding of their tools' capabilities. This is where AI literacy differs from digital literacy—you're not just learning an interface, you're learning to think alongside a system that adapts to you while you adapt to it.
- **Experiment**: The experimentation phase requires the most patience. Depending on the complexity of AI-native tools, it may require unlearning habits from non-AI versions of that tool. The experimentation process helps us visualize how we want to integrate this tool into our daily lives—if at all. There are some tools that you'll discover are interesting but not necessarily useful in your day-to-day. Workflow compatibility matters more than feature sets.
- **Apply**: Once you find tools that you click with, it requires active effort to integrate them into your workflows, which may mean changing your habits and practicing using the tools. I write my drafts on Notion, and Claude has strong integrations where it can directly access my Notion page for proofreading. Claude can also read my computer files where I have lots of writing samples for it to learn my writing style and offer tailored suggestions with Claude Code. Sometimes you'll discover unexpected use cases—I never expected Claude Code to be useful for non-technical work, but it transformed how I interact with my computer and execute the writing process. Integrating a new tool is similar to breaking in new shoes.
- **Evaluate**: Given the pace of innovation in the space, existing AI systems are getting better and new tools are spawning regularly. This requires frequent evaluation of our technology stack, ensuring we always use the best tools to enhance our workflows. For example, I had to switch from Gemini to Claude when I started writing regularly—I discovered that switching between apps during the writing process created productivity bottlenecks that a more integrated tool, like Claude, could solve. But there's a caveat to tool switching—sometimes, a "good enough" tool you use consistently beats a "perfect" tool you abandon after two weeks. The goal isn't to have the latest tools; it's to build sustainable practices for consistent use.

This cycle helps make us into purposeful adopters and work towards a future where purposeful and previously sporadic adopters alike capitalize on the benefits it will have across different dimensions of our lives: the desirable future state. This future only becomes a reality if we invest time and energy into finding ways for AI to enhance our lives.
