# Ed by LAUSD

Date: January 22, 2026

## Intro

I recently learned about Ed, a defunct AI project led by Superintendent Alberto Carvalho in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) through a partnership with AllHere, a former AI company. Ed’s failure was especially disappointing to me because I grew up attending LAUSD schools from K-8; I only attended in a charter high school because my mom believed I’d have a better chance at graduating and going to college if I attended a charter school instead of the local public high school. Not every family has this option, so I am a huge advocate for initiatives that improve outcomes for students in public schools and am a strong believer that technology is the most effective way to achieve this at scale—particularly in large urban districts like LAUSD that serves ~500K students and rural, distant districts like Sheridan County Schools serving ~4,000 students.  

While Ed has become a popular argument against AI in public schools, any technology would have failed under LAUSD’s vision (absent the failures by AllHere CEO who was later charged with fraud). After learning about this project, I wanted to take time to write about three things:

1. Ed’s objectives and capabilities
2. Alternative views to technology deployment in education
3. Example of effective edtech deployment

## Ed

Carvalho sold Ed as an AI-powered tool for students, parents, and teachers that aggregates district data to help improve student learning, increase attendance and engagement, and give teachers real-time insight into student performance. During ASU + GSV Summit in 2024, Carvalho went through his vision for Ed and the role it would play in the student experience; based on his keynote and panel discussion, below are the objectives Carvalho explicitly mentioned and how Ed’s capabilities would achieve those objectives:

|  | Objectives | Capabilities |

|  |  | Build and use individual data profiles (attendance, academics, preferences) |
|  |  | Adapt content to reading level and language style |
|  |  | Deliver targeted learning activities in one platform |
|  |  | Nudge and incentivize students based on their profiles |
|  |  | Update learning paths from interaction data |

|  |  | Expose students to AI‑mediated problem‑solving |
| 8 | Unify curricular and digital resources in one interface |  |
|  |  | Integrate third‑party content providers into Ed |
|  |  | Route students to partner content without extra log‑ins |
|  |  | Support use across common devices with single sign‑on |
|  |  | Standardize access through a shared platform |
| 9 | Manage practical aspects of school life |  |
|  |  | Show school meal menus and daily weather |
|  |  | Send reminders for events and deadlines |
|  |  | Connect students to homework help in‑platform |
|  |  | Provide real‑time bus arrival information |
|  |  | Centralize academic and non‑academic services |

Keeping up with Carvalho in the [keynote where he first unveiled Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXUNr1j5CkU) was challenging. His confident storytelling paints a rosy picture around Ed’s potential but hides the practicality for AllHere and Ed to solve the laundry list of challenges in school districts. 

Building a high-quality product around even one of these objectives, such as “creating personalized learning pathways for each child”, can take years to polish. A general purpose product that targets learning, teaching, absenteeism, communication, and analytics compounds the resources necessary to build a functional, reliable prototype. This ambitious undertaking was most likely led by AllHere, the AI vendor, to increase the size of the contract, but this unrestrained ambition is also what set LAUSD up for failure. 

## Out of scope

When I first joined consulting, I was confused by partners’ intense focus on outlining, in detail, the deliverables for our projects. Partners worked diligently on defining the questions clients want answered, the work product that will help answer those questions, and the timeline for project milestones. Particularly in short projects it was critical for the team to focus on reliably answering the predefined questions clients wanted to answer; our day-to-day tasks revolved around the work product (analyses, interviews, or research) that helped uncover answers. Over time, the value of having clear objectives and aligning resources around that objective became clear to me. Otherwise, it’s easy to get pulled by seemingly productive tasks that don’t contribute to the objective and result in wasting time and resources.

In consulting, the impact of inefficiency was immediately felt by the firm: late deliverables meant current projects were extended (at no additional cost to the client) and new projects were delayed (and sometimes lost). In education, that same visibility into the impact of failed projects does not exist; but expensive projects like Ed, in addition to the millions of lost taxpayer dollars, lead to the continued failure of giving students the best possible education, which is arguably the greatest loss but least visible.

The high stakes of public education, whose goal is to prepare students for future academic and professional opportunities, suggests that a similar disciplined approach in technology projects is necessary to improve outcomes for students as quickly as possible. I am bullish on AI’s ability to address existing gaps in public education, but this post is about the growing responsibility for district leaders to rigorously focus technology deployment around desired outcomes and district priorities.

The biggest limitation to this approach, however, is the political nature of the superintendent role, who is beholden to the members of the board of education where board members each have priorities that aren’t necessarily improving student achievement. The lack of alignment presents a huge vulnerability to the effectiveness of district leaders while they are focused on managing different agendas.

## Narrow Way

School districts face many simultaneous, urgent challenges: operational inefficiency, learning loss, absenteeism, teacher shortages, and teacher wages, among others. But over the past few days, I’ve been focused on the concerning math and English test scores in elementary schools. In the elementary school I attended, for example, only 19% and 22% meet or exceed state standards in math and English, respectively; given that most of the students’ parents at this elementary school did not graduate from high school, public schools are the main (and sometimes only) source of learning. So it is particularly urgent for schools to address learning gaps with immediacy. Specialized edtech solutions, at the moment, offer the most scalable and efficient avenue for school districts.

Fortunately, there is a growing number of edtech startups addressing specific challenges in education, which reduces the bandwidth required from districts to drive high-impact technology initiatives. This isn’t a market map but I want to include a positive example of what I mean by specialized edtech companies. Staying on the topic of math learning, I recently discovered Innovamat, an edtech company focused on improving math proficiency for students in K-8.

Innovamat has built a math learning platform that revolves around the lifecycle of learning: curriculum planning, instruction, and measurement. Additionally, Innovamat offers parents resources to support their students’ math learning at home and runs an internal research center to improve the efficacy of their programs. This rigorous focus on math learning has helped students improve math performance on standardized tests in schools globally (see [here](https://blog.innovamat.com/en/research-study-results-on-the-impact-of-innovamat-on-standardized-tests/)).

Innovamat’s approach to supporting school districts is a stark contrast to LAUSD’s partnership with AllHere. The scope Innovamat offers for schools is limited to math learning among a specific age group and everyone is better off for it: district leaders, teachers, and most importantly, students.

It may be harsh to focus on a big swing Superintendent Carvalho took 3 years ago with AllHere. And I recognize that solutions to the deep-rooted problems in public education will be through ambitious initiatives and investments. But when missing the mark has such a profound and long-term impact on students' lives, there must be a higher standard for district leaders and technology deployments. Students deserve it.
